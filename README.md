# Mini_Google_C_DataStructure

This is my 3rd Semester Academic project and is coded on C language making use of Data Structure.

This project performs searching and matching of user input using Linked list and file handling concept. 
It also helps you in case of some scenario where you may know the correct pronunciation of a word but may not be confident/ familiar with the correct letters. For that, the user can select from a variety of categories and search for the particular keyword using at least any two-letter of that keyword/ word.

Programming concept used:
1> Structure
2> Dynamic Memory Allocation
3> Linked List
4> Files
